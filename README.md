# Data-Augmentation
* For Img_augmentation notebook, there are 2 principal parts in this notebook : 
  - **Data Augmentation With Library imgaug.augmenters**
  - **Data Augmentation With Tensorflow**

  For part 1 : There are somme methods for data augmentation using **imgaug**

  For part 2 : 

  +  Methods for data augmentation using **tf.image**
        
  + Comparison of model using data augmented and data non-augmented.

  The results demonstrate that data augmentation helps avoid overfitting.

  All data necessary are in folder **data**.
* For MixUp_image_augmentation notebook :

  Mix-up technique : https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412
  
  We use mnist dataset for comparison between model with mixed up dataset and original dataset.
