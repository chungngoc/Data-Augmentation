# Data-Augmentation

There are 2 principal parts in the Notebook : 
 - **Data Augmentation With Library imgaug.augmenters**
 - **Data Augmentation With Tensorflow**

For part 1 : There are somme methods for data augmentation using **imgaug**

For part 2 : 

+  Methods for data augmentation using **tfimage**
        
+ Comparison of model using data augmented and data non-augmented.

The results demonstrate that data augmentation helps avoid overfitting.

All data necessary are in folder **data**.
